<h4>The Seahawks head to the Bay Area this weekend for a Week 2 game against the 49ers, and will do so with nearly every player on the 53-man roster available.
That will include rookie running back Kenneth Walker III, who is poised to make his NFL debut after missing the opener while recovering from a hernia procedure.
"Kenny made it through the week," Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. "I just walked off the field with him, and he's really excited to be ready to go."
When it comes to Walker making his debut, the Seahawks are excited to see the second-round pick show off the skillset that was evident in training camp before he was sidelined with the hernia. Carroll noted that includes much-improved pass-blocking ability, which is something he wasn't really called upon to do in college, but that he has done well with the Seahawks.
"From the first day on, he was getting after it," Carroll said of Walker picking up that part of the game. "And it wasn't even a problem, it was just a statement about his pride and how tough he is and how committed he is to being everything he can be and all of that. And the rest of it, he's got great speed. He's extremely elusive, tremendous side-to-side ability to get away and escape. He caught the ball really well and then all of that, and he's tough. He's just a tough freakin' dude that doesn't want to give up anything. You put that all together and you have a tough looking guy. So we've been really high on him, and I was looking to see on what would happen last week just because I'm hopeful to see him be a part of it. We did the right thing. We waited another week. He got some good banging on it and feels fine and he's ready to go. He's safe and all that. We're just really excited for him to be a contributor to the whole thing."

Said Walker, "It feels good (to be back). I'm just trying to get comfortable again, getting a feel of being on the field again with the guys, but I'm happy to be back."</h4>
