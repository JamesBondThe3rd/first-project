<h4 id ="player of the week">

<p>Not since 2005 had an NFL player thrown for, caught and rushed for a touchdown in a single game.
Running back Christian McCaffrey did it in just his second game with the San Francisco 49ers.
McCaffrey wasn't the only back to run to a history-making showing on Sunday as the Tennessee Titans' Derrick Henry extended his NFL record with a sixth game in which he rushed for 200-plus yards and multiple touchdowns.
On the heels of their stellar showings, McCaffrey and Henry were recognized Wednesday among the league's Players of the Week.
McCaffrey keyed the 49ers' 31-14 comeback win over the rival Los Angeles Rams with his touchdown hat trick. He threw for a 34-yard touchdown pass, caught a 9-yard touchdown and rushed for a 1-yard score. In total, he had 94 yards on 18 carries and 55 yards on eight catches en route to collecting NFC Offensive Player of the Week.

He tallied seven tackles, three tackles for loss and a sack in the victory.
Minnesota Vikings linebacker Za'Darius Smith took home NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors after his performance in his squad's 34-26 win over the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday. Smith posted seven tackles, three sacks, four tackles for loss and a pass breakup.

Seattle Seahawks tight end Will Dissly had a pair of catches on Sunday, but it was his contributions in the kicking game that led to him being named NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Dissly had a forced fumble and a fumble recovery on separate plays in punt coverage during Seattle's 27-13 victory against the New York Giants.
The ever-dependable Nick Folk was a driving force in the New England Patriots' 22-17 win over the New York Jets on Sunday. The kicker was recognized as AFC Special Teams Player of the Week after converting all six of his kicks. Folk, who converted his one point-after attempt, booted five fields goals in as many attempts, including three from beyond 40 yards and one from 52. Copyright NFL.com

• From 2019-20, Henry established a streak of 20 consecutive games in the regular season and playoffs with at least 18 rushing attempts, the second-longest streak of its kind in the NFL since 1948.
